* Since Ngspice does not support noise figure simulation with S2P files, an equivalent π-model has been used in place of the S2P data.
* The schematic file *220GHz_LNA(MAIN).sch* represents the main design that utilizes the S2P files.
* The schematic file *220GHz_LNA_pi_model.sch* contains the equivalent π-model used as a substitute for the S2P data.
